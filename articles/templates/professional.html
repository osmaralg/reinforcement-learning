Had to be in constant contact with the internal warehouse and the supply chain area to fit the right

also learned how to resume and obtain relevant information from datasheets with thousands of
part numbers.Finally, learned how to act according to a sale forecast, a production plan, and a
warehouse space limit. </p>
